            Hi, we're the founders! Our names are Chabeli Yumang and Gurleen Kaur and weâ€™re both juniors at TJ. 
            Chabeli has always been interested in earth science and Gurleen has a passion for marine biology. 
            We were looking for summer activities related to our interests and noticed that almost everything was extremely expensive: 
            trips to islands that cost thousands of dollars or college programs equally high-priced. We had also noticed that, 
            in general, opportunities for children to learn geoscience or marine science outside of the classroom were limited 
            and not affordable. Thus, we decided to start teaching children about the marine and earth sciences and
             to keep lessons completely free and open to just about anyone. This serves both as a way of further 
             exploring our passions and making marine/geoscience education more accessible.
        </p>
